The funnel thanks to its innovatible split design, can be operated as a _standalone dosing funnel_, with both pieces attached, or with _just one_ allowing to use the built-in breville grinder without crashing with the grinder fork for a mess-free shot prep. The two mating parts automatically snaps together thanks to their four neodymium high-stregth magnets.
